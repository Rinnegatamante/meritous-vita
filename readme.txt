MERITOUS v 1.2
for Windows 98/2K/XP/other operating systems
by Lancer-X/ASCEAI

Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.     
A place of limitless power. Those that seek to
control such a utopia will soon bring an end        
to themselves.                       

Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him,
PSI user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus
Dome in search of answers.

Run Meritous.exe after extraction and everything should work correctly.

If the game is too difficult for you, you can play in 'Wuss mode' for
a far more sombre gaming experience.

             them and push against them.

             around the map.

             for reading in-game dialogue.
